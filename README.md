In this project done at ETHDam 2024 I predict the success of newly minted ERC20 tokens on Ethereum by using only features extracted from their smartcontracts using Slither. Success is defined as reaching 100k marketcap at any point within the same month that they were created, I use a lightGBM model to predict this binary success variable and obtain a model that is significantly better than random chance, with an accuracy of 63%, a precision of 69%, a recall of 80% and an F1 Score of 74%. These results are the average of training using cross-validation across 10 folds to avoid overfitting the results to the training set.

To form the dataset I query the Ethereum blockchain using Web.py and an RPC for a newly minted ERC20 token in the first few days of March 2024, I then record the highest market-capitalization they reached within the month using BitQuery for the price and Web3.py for the supply and I analyze the smart contracts of these tokens using Slither to extract the number of state variables they use across all the contracts of the token and number of contracts, the uniqueness of the names of these state variables and contract names as judged by the TF-IDF comparing the state names of each token against a corpus of the state variables of all other tokens considered.
