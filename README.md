In this project done at ETHDam 2024 I predict the success of newly minted ERC20 tokens on Ethereum by using only features extracted from their smartcontracts.

I query the Ethereum blockchain using Web.py and an RPC for a newly minted ERC20 token in the first few days of March 2024, I then record the highest marketcapitalization they reached within the month using BitQuery for the price and Web3.py for the supply and I analyze the smart contracts of these tokens using Slither to extract the number of state variables they use across all the contracts of the token and number of contracts, the uniqueness of the names of these state variables and contract names as judged by the TF-iDF comparing the state names of each token against a corpus of the state variables of all other tokens considered.
