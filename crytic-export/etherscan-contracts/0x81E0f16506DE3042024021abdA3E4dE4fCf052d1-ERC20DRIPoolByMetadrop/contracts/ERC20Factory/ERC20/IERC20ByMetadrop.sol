  /**
   * @dev function {addInitialLiquidity}
   *
   * Add initial liquidity to the uniswap pair
   *
   * @param vaultFee_ The vault fee in wei. This must match the required fee from the external vault contract.
   * @param lpLockupInDaysOverride_ The number of days to lock liquidity NOTE you can pass 0 to use the stored value.
   * This value is an override, and will override a stored value which is LOWER that it. If the value you are passing is
   * LOWER than the stored value the stored value will not be reduced.
   *
   * Example usage 1: When creating the coin the lpLockupInDays is set to 0. This means that on this call the
   * user can set the lockup to any value they like, as all integer values greater than zero will be used to override
   * that set in storage.
   *
   * Example usage 2: When using a DRI Pool the lockup period is set on this contract and the pool need not know anything
   * about this setting. The pool can pass back a 0 on this call and know that the existing value stored on this contract
   * will be used.
   * @param burnLPTokensOverride_ If the LP tokens should be burned (otherwise they are locked). This is an override field
   * that can ONLY be used to override a held value of FALSE with a new value of TRUE.
   *
   * Example usage 1: When creating the coin the user didn't add liquidity, or specify that the LP tokens were to be burned.
   * So burnLPTokens is held as FALSE. When they add liquidity they want to lock tokens, so they pass this in as FALSE again,
   * and it remains FALSE.
   *
   * Example usage 2: As above, but when later adding liquidity the user wants to burn the LP. So the stored value is FALSE
   * and the user passes TRUE into this method. The TRUE overrides the held value of FALSE and the tokens are burned.
   *
   * Example uusage 3: The user is using a DRI pool and they have specified on the coin creation that the LP tokens are to
   * be burned. This contract therefore holds TRUE for burnLPTokens. The DRI pool does not need to know what the user has
   * selected. It can safely pass back FALSE to this method call and the stored value of TRUE will remain, resulting in the
   * LP tokens being burned.
